Use
===

You must be in project directory.

Copy pymmr.default.cfg to pymmr.cfg:

	cp pymmr.default.cfg pymmr.cfg

You may want to edit it.

You can run it on terminal like that:

	./pymmr /music/directory/on/your/system

Even at this stage, files should not be modified by PyMMR.
I recommand to try it on a copy.

For the GTK client:

	./gmmr
