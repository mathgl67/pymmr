 * python gtk 

OTHER
------

 * Coverage (for coverage setup setup command)
 * python-sphinx (for build_sphinx setup command)

Use
===

You must be in project directory.

Copy pymmr.default.cfg to pymmr.cfg:

	cp pymmr.default.cfg pymmr.cfg

You may want to edit it.

You can run it on terminal like that:

	./pymmr /music/directory/on/your/system

Even at this stage, files should not be modified by PyMMR.
I recommand to try it on a copy.

For the GTK client:

	./gmmr


API DOCUMENTATION
=================

You can generate documentation if you have python-sphinx installed by the following command:

	./setup.py build_sphinx

Documentation will be store in: build/sphinx/html
